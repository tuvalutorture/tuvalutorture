 ### Hello! I'm tuvalutorture! :D

I'm a hobbyist coder, who likes to make miscellaneous programs and OSes, using mostly C, but also wanting to learn Obj-C and Swift (maybe some c++ in the future, but i dont touch that nerd shit) :P 

check out this lovely project i'm actively working on that might get me sued by a trillion-dollar company! (or hopefully hired. always a non-zero chance amirite? *sobs violently* PLEASE HIRE ME RECRUITER MAN AT THE FRUIT CULT I SWEAR I PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO STEVE JOBS AND TIMOTHY PLEASE) [MacInDOSh, a free, open source standalone x86 recreation of the Classic Mac OS!](https://github.com/turrnutorg/MacInDOSh)
