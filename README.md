(or hopefully hired. always a non-zero chance amirite? *sobs violently* PLEASE HIRE ME RECRUITER MAN AT THE FRUIT CULT I SWEAR I PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO STEVE JOBS AND TIMOTHY PLEASE) [MacInDOSh, a free, open source standalone x86 recreation of the Classic Mac OS!](https://github.com/turrnutorg/MacInDOSh)

"A long, long, long, long time ago  
Before the wind, before the snow  
Lived a man, lived a man I know   
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho   
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me  
Sometimes I find I need to scream"
