Hello! I'm tuvalutorture! :D

I'm a 14 year old hobbyist coder, who likes to make miscellaneous terminal applications and OSes, using mostly C. 

I'm also currently working on my own Unity project (michael of wave), which i plan to eventually release :DDD (not open source atm, will be later)

check out this lovely project i'm actively working on that might get me sued (or hopefully hired. always a non-zero chance amirite? *sobs violently* PLEASE HIRE ME RECRUITER MAN AT THE FRUIT CULT I SWEAR I PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO STEVE JOBS AND TIMOTHY PLEASE) by a trillion-dollar company! [MacInDOSh, a free, open source standalone x86 recreation of the Classic Mac OS!](https://github.com/turrnutorg/MacInDOSh)

A long, long, long, long time ago  
Before the wind, before the snow  
Lived a man, lived a man I know   
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho   
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me  
Sometimes I find I need to scream   

kefka from ffvi was kinda based and in the right ngl and his boss theme is my spirit animal
