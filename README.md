check out this lovely project i'm actively working on that might get me sued by a trillion-dollar company! (or hopefully hired. always a non-zero chance amirite? *sobs violently* PLEASE HIRE ME RECRUITER MAN AT THE FRUIT CULT I SWEAR I PLEDGE MY LOYALTY TO STEVE JOBS AND TIMOTHY PLEASE) [MacInDOSh, a free, open source standalone x86 recreation of the Classic Mac OS!](https://github.com/turrnutorg/MacInDOSh)

"Right or wrong, my song is strong  
You don't like it, get along  
Say what I want, do what I can  
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan  
I don't buy supremacy  
A-media chief, you menace me  
The people you say cause all the crime  
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime"
