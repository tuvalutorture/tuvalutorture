Hello! I'm tuvalutorture! :D

I'm a 14 year old hobbyist coder, who likes to make miscellaneous terminal applications and OSes, using mostly C. 

I'm also currently working on my own Unity project, which i plan to eventually release :DDD (not open source atm, will be later)

check out this lovely project i'm actively working on that might get me sued (or hopefully hired. always a non-zero chance amirite? *sobs violently*) by a trillion-dollar company! [MacInDOSh, a free, open source recreation of the Classic Mac OS!](https://github.com/turrnutorg/MacInDOSh)

If you need to contact me for any reason, feel free to reach out at my email, tuvalutorture@icloud.com. You will likely be ignored for several days as i do not check my emails.

p.s.
